#rules/values of the programming club (as of June 29, 2016)

## # the teach rule
1\. Teach what you know. Share your "not very important" knowledge. Do your best to help your colleagues understand what you teach. Help each other understand the topic being discussed. 

2\. If you know something that a colleague missed in his discussion, share that to the group. 

## # the listen rule
3\. Listen to your colleague and do your best to understand what he is trying to teach. 

## # the ask rule
4\. Ask your stupid question. Ask your question even if you feel like your colleagues will think you are being stupid for asking the question. 

5\. Ask your question even if you "know" that no one in the group is able to answer your question. (Someone might know someone not in the group who can answer your question) 

 - “Albert grunted. "Do you know what happens to lads who ask too many questions?"<br/>
   Mort thought for a moment.<br/>
   "No," he said eventually, "what?"<br/>
   There was silence.<br/>
   Then Albert straightened up and said, "Damned if I know. <br/>
   Probably they get answers, and serve 'em right.” <br/>
   ― Terry Pratchett, Mort (from Goodreads.com's [Quotes About Questions](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/questions)
    
 - If you do not ask your question you might never know the answer (and you might never know the next question to ask). 

## # the answer rule
6\. Answer your colleague's question. "I don't know" is also an answer. 

## # the "time is precious" rule
7\. Don't take your colleague's time away from him. If you have already taken so much of the group's time and your colleague has not yet taken any of the group's time, then it's "time out for you" time. 

## # the honor rule
8\. If a club member makes a mistake, politely and constructively correct him/her.
 
9\. Accept polite and constructive correction/criticism. 

10\. Politely correct impolite correction/criticism. 

11\. Do everything to prevent divisiveness. No gossiping about how stupid your colleague is. Help him/her instead. (And also no gossiping about other people :) -- kay basig tawagon ta nila sa sunod nga “gossip club”) 

12\. No heated emotional debates; just peaceful logical discussions. No ad hominems please. Remember that your colleague did not but-ho here by chance. We choose him/her to be part of this group. (We can also use this to answer the question "Why would I follow the rules listed here?") 

13\. Avoid comparing yourself with others. Instead, compare yourself with your previous self.

 - “If someone is doing better than you, it only means that he started work on himself earlier than you did” (and vice versa) – David Schwartz?  --- so start working today.

## # the "we are not robots" rule
14\. We might make some mistakes. But let's not give so much focus on the rules listed here. (We should not spend our time waiting for our colleague to break one of the rules so we can have a reason to kick him out.) Let's focus on productive sharing of knowledge. But... 

15\. ...if you do not follow the rules listed here and become burdensome to the club, it is possible for you to be kicked out of the club.

## # the "modify the rules when needed" rule.
16\. We do not know all the goods and evils in the world. We are not like God who can see the future. We fail to remember the past; we make mistakes. And the needs of the future might be different from the needs of the present. Modify the other rules as needed (including the English :) ). The entire group decides. 

## # the schooling first rule
17\. Don't let the club hinder your goals at school. Do your important school homework first before doing the club's homework. 

## # the “write clean code” rule.

18\. Let's learn how to write clean code and let's do our best to put into practice what we have learned. (I suggest never to remove this rule because this is the primary reason why this club was made) 

 - Writing “clean code” means being professional when writing code – dili dapat “basta ga-gana lang ok na na”. We need to consider other things such as “is it easy to read?”, “is it easy to maintain”, "is it secure", things like that. Of course we might never know everything about writing clean code… i-try lang nato.
	 
 - "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler
